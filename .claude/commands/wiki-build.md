# Founder OS wiki-build

Refresh the auto-extracted half of `brain/relations.yaml`. The hand-curated `relations:` section (semantic edges with type: informs/blocks/guards_against/etc.) is preserved untouched. Only the block between the auto-generated sentinel markers is replaced.

## Procedure

1. If `core/identity.md` does not exist, reply `Founder OS not set up here. Run /founder-os:setup first.` and stop.

2. If `scripts/wiki-build.py` does not exist, reply `Wiki-build script not found. Run /founder-os:setup or /founder-os:update to install it.` and stop.

3. Run the build script:
   ```bash
   python scripts/wiki-build.py
   ```

4. Report the output line verbatim. Example: `Wrote 12 wiki links from 4 source files into brain/relations.yaml`.

5. If the script exits non-zero, report the error message verbatim and stop. Do NOT attempt to fix the underlying issue automatically.

6. Do NOT commit. The user commits manually after review.

## Wikilink syntax (Obsidian-compatible)

| Form | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `[[target]]` | Bare slug. Resolved at query time. |
| `[[target.md]]` | Explicit file (basename or repo-relative path). |
| `[[target.md#anchor]]` | File with heading anchor. |
| `[[target\|display text]]` | Alias form. Display text is discarded for the graph. |

## Rules

- Read-only on source markdown. The script only writes to `brain/relations.yaml`.
- Wiki-layer scope: `core/`, `context/`, `cadence/`, `brain/`, `network/`, `companies/`. Plugin-internal directories (`.claude/`, `skills/`, `templates/`, `docs/`) and the source archive (`raw/`) are excluded.
- Wikilinks inside fenced code blocks or inline backtick spans are ignored (so docs that describe the syntax do not pollute the graph).
- The script is idempotent. Running twice in a row produces no diff.
- Do not edit the auto-generated block by hand. Edits between `#@@WIKI_LINKS_AUTOGEN_BEGIN@@` and `#@@WIKI_LINKS_AUTOGEN_END@@` are overwritten on next run. Add semantic edges to the hand-curated `relations:` section instead.

## When to run

- After any session that added 3+ wikilinks to your OS.
- Before `/founder-os:lint` if you want lint to see the freshest cross-reference graph.
- Manually when curiosity strikes ("what links to context/clients.md?").

Not on a cron. Auto-running on session start would add latency for marginal value. Manual is fine.

## Voice

- No em dashes or en dashes. Hyphens only.
- No commentary outside what the procedure says to output.
