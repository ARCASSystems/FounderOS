# Changelog

All notable releases. Format follows the user-value-first commit naming rule (`rules/commit-naming.md`).

## v1.4.3 - 2026-05-06

- Avatar moves from marketing artifact to user-owned template, populated from your real patterns over time
- AGENTS.md catches up to the v1.4 surface so non-Claude agents see the same commands and substrate
- Public commits now follow a user-readable naming rule (`rules/commit-naming.md`)
- Brain templates teach the v1.4 lifecycle by example so fresh installs see the convention modelled, not just claimed
- GEMINI.md removed. It was a 7-line stub. AGENTS.md covers the cross-agent contract.
- Notion package gets a louder in-development banner so visitors do not assume it installs today
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` added (public-repo standards)
- Stale "v1.2" references in `docs/tools-and-mcps.md` swept to current state
- Readiness output now reads "high-impact" instead of corporate jargon across all surfaces

## v1.4.2 - 2026-05-03

- Windows users now get the SessionStart brief without git-bash (PowerShell hooks wired automatically)
- Voice fallback unified across all six writing skills so a missing voice profile warns and falls back instead of stopping
- Setup wizard and readiness-check now read and write the same backlog file (`core/setup-backlog.md`)
- Bash decay scanner regex fixed for Python compatibility
- Plugin manifest repository field corrected to spec
- Currency rule in proposal-writer made geography-neutral
- README positioning rewritten to broaden audience from "solo founder" to "the person running the business"

## v1.4.1 - 2026-05-02

- Bootloader template now ships the v1.4 substrate so fresh installs see the same CLAUDE.md as upgraded installs
- Setup wizard explicitly copies hooks to the user repo so the SessionStart brief actually fires after install
- README skill count drift fixed (22-of-26 to 23-of-27)

## v1.4.0 - 2026-05-02

- Wiki graph builder skill (`/founder-os:wiki-build`) walks markdown, extracts `[[wikilinks]]`, and writes the graph to `brain/relations.yaml`
- Brain entries can now declare `Decay after: 14d`. Past the date, the SessionStart brief surfaces them for keep / kill review.
- New `system/quarantine.md` catch-net for silent hook and scheduled-task failures
- New `rules/approval-gates.md` matrix listing what auto-runs, what requires explicit yes, and what is blocked outright
- SessionStart brief hook surfaces flags, stale cadence, decay-due entries, and quarantine ACTIVE failures in one screen at session open

## v1.3.0 - 2026-04-30

- Source ingest skill (`/founder-os:ingest`) files external sources into `raw/` with provenance frontmatter, then proposes wiki updates the operator approves
- Read-only wiki lint (`/founder-os:lint`) audits cross-references, orphans, stale time-sensitive content, provenance gaps, and possible contradictions
- `[[wikilink]]` cross-reference convention introduced (forward-only; existing files not retrofitted)

## v1.2.0 - 2026-04-28

- Three voice-coupled writing skills shipped: `linkedin-post`, `client-update`, `proposal-writer`
- `readiness-check` skill and `/founder-os:status` command return a weighted readiness score and the next 3 high-impact moves
- `/founder-os:uninstall` ships with a default mode that preserves user data and a `--purge` mode that wipes everything
- Plugin marketplace install path fixed (schema bug that was silently failing)
