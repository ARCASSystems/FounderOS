# Changelog

All notable releases. Format follows the user-value-first commit naming rule (`rules/commit-naming.md`).

## v1.6.0 - 2026-05-07

The retrieval and ship-safety release. FounderOS now has a clearer first-week path and a working way to ask the OS what connects to what.

- README skills are now grouped by real usage cadence: Day 1, Week 1, and Month 1+. Install stays above the fold, and substrate details move below the user-facing ship list.
- Eight public-safe operating skills land: forcing-questions, blind-spot-review, ship-deliverable, approval-gates, handoff-protocol, context-persistence, data-security, and bottleneck-diagnostic.
- Four commands land: `/founder-os:forcing-questions`, `/founder-os:ship-deliverable`, `/founder-os:query`, and `/founder-os:audit`.
- `brain/knowledge/` becomes the durable note layer. knowledge-capture writes topic files, and proposal-writer plus strategic-analysis read matching notes back before drafting.
- `/founder-os:query` adds plain markdown and YAML traversal through `brain/relations.yaml`, boot files, patterns, flags, and knowledge notes. No embeddings, no external database.
- `/founder-os:audit` defines one health report across readiness, lint, wiki state, brain staleness, and voice completeness.
- Setup now creates `brain/knowledge/` and copies both `wiki-build.py` and `query.py` helper scripts for fresh installs.
- Version, manifests, README, CLAUDE.md, and AGENTS.md now reflect the v1.6 surface: 37 skills and 19 commands.

## v1.5.0 - 2026-05-07

The tailoring + memory release. The wizard's answers now reach the skills they should reach.

- Setup wizard answers (decision style, communication style, tool stack) are now structured fields the skills actually read. Previously the wizard captured rich answers and only voice/brand profiles flowed downstream. Six daily skills (sop-writer, meeting-prep, email-drafter, strategic-analysis, decision-framework, your-voice) now read identity, operating-rules, and `stack.json` so output is specific instead of generic
- `/rant` and `/dream` commands ship - capture the volume that is the thinking, then distil unprocessed rants into patterns, flags, parked decisions, needs-input, and client signals with a 5-line digest written to brain/log.md
- `brain/rants/` folder convention with frontmatter (`captured`, `processed: false|true`)
- `brain/needs-input.md` joins the brain layer as the "what is blocked on you" channel
- Auto-memory layer documented and seeded - `templates/memory/MEMORY.md` is a four-section index (Behavioral Guards, Active Project Context, Review Due, Expired) the wizard now writes into Claude Code's per-project memory location so behavioral corrections persist across sessions
- Setup wizard hardened: mandatory script copy step (so `/founder-os:wiki-build` does not fail post-install) and mandatory rants folder creation
- Brain example entries seeded with real dates so the SessionStart brief actually surfaces them on Day 1, demonstrating the decay convention by example
- `brain/relations.yaml` ships with three seeded curated edges so users see the format by example rather than spec
- README defines substrate / brain / wiki vocabulary in one block at the top of "What you actually get" - the existing audit's biggest jargon-density bounce point closed
- README setup line restructured as a four-step ladder (Install -> Setup -> Voice -> Brand) so users do not see `/founder-os:setup` before they have an install path
- `docs/first-day.md` adds "A real Tuesday" walkthrough and a [FILL] placeholder explanation - the missing "what does it actually feel like" content the audit flagged

## v1.4.3 - 2026-05-06

- Avatar moves from marketing artifact to user-owned template, populated from your real patterns over time
- AGENTS.md catches up to the v1.4 surface so non-Claude agents see the same commands and substrate
- Public commits now follow a user-readable naming rule (`rules/commit-naming.md`)
- Brain templates teach the v1.4 lifecycle by example so fresh installs see the convention modelled, not just claimed
- GEMINI.md removed. It was a 7-line stub. AGENTS.md covers the cross-agent contract.
- Notion package gets a louder in-development banner so visitors do not assume it installs today
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` added (public-repo standards)
- Stale "v1.2" references in `docs/tools-and-mcps.md` swept to current state
- Readiness output now reads "high-impact" instead of corporate jargon across all surfaces

## v1.4.2 - 2026-05-03

- Windows users now get the SessionStart brief without git-bash (PowerShell hooks wired automatically)
- Voice fallback unified across all six writing skills so a missing voice profile warns and falls back instead of stopping
- Setup wizard and readiness-check now read and write the same backlog file (`core/setup-backlog.md`)
- Bash decay scanner regex fixed for Python compatibility
- Plugin manifest repository field corrected to spec
- Currency rule in proposal-writer made geography-neutral
- README positioning rewritten to broaden audience from "solo founder" to "the person running the business"

## v1.4.1 - 2026-05-02

- Bootloader template now ships the v1.4 substrate so fresh installs see the same CLAUDE.md as upgraded installs
- Setup wizard explicitly copies hooks to the user repo so the SessionStart brief actually fires after install
- README skill count drift fixed (22-of-26 to 23-of-27)

## v1.4.0 - 2026-05-02

- Wiki graph builder skill (`/founder-os:wiki-build`) walks markdown, extracts `[[wikilinks]]`, and writes the graph to `brain/relations.yaml`
- Brain entries can now declare `Decay after: 14d`. Past the date, the SessionStart brief surfaces them for keep / kill review.
- New `system/quarantine.md` catch-net for silent hook and scheduled-task failures
- New `rules/approval-gates.md` matrix listing what auto-runs, what requires explicit yes, and what is blocked outright
- SessionStart brief hook surfaces flags, stale cadence, decay-due entries, and quarantine ACTIVE failures in one screen at session open

## v1.3.0 - 2026-04-30

- Source ingest skill (`/founder-os:ingest`) files external sources into `raw/` with provenance frontmatter, then proposes wiki updates the operator approves
- Read-only wiki lint (`/founder-os:lint`) audits cross-references, orphans, stale time-sensitive content, provenance gaps, and possible contradictions
- `[[wikilink]]` cross-reference convention introduced (forward-only; existing files not retrofitted)

## v1.2.0 - 2026-04-28

- Three voice-coupled writing skills shipped: `linkedin-post`, `client-update`, `proposal-writer`
- `readiness-check` skill and `/founder-os:status` command return a weighted readiness score and the next 3 high-impact moves
- `/founder-os:uninstall` ships with a default mode that preserves user data and a `--purge` mode that wipes everything
- Plugin marketplace install path fixed (schema bug that was silently failing)

## Earlier versions

Earlier work happened on a feature branch and merged into main as v1.0.0. See `git log` for the history.
