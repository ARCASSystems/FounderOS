name: catch-up
description: >
  Sweep everything captured away from the laptop into the brain. Trigger on "catch up", "process my inbox", "I sent myself some notes", "here's what I captured today", or a paste of raw voice-note transcripts. Reads capture/inbox/ (and pasted text, and a connected meeting-notes tool when one is wired), files each item into brain/rants/ with provenance and processed: false, applies the names-glossary correction pass, then offers /dream to distil. One mental model: get the thought into the inbox any way you can; the OS files it.
why: "The real work happens away from the desk. A thought that cannot land in the brain until the founder is back at a laptop usually never lands at all. The inbox makes capture a dump, not a task."
enhance: "Pair with a capture channel that fits your day (docs/capture-anywhere.md ranks them by friction) and run /dream after a sweep so captures become patterns, flags, and decisions instead of sitting raw."

# Catch up - sweep the inbox into the brain

Runs on: local-writes - files things into `brain/rants/`; on a read-only surface it drafts what it would file and says so.

The founder captured thoughts somewhere else - a voice-note app, an email to self, saved messages, a text file dictated into a synced folder. This skill gets them into the brain with provenance, without asking the founder to structure anything.

## Sources, in sweep order

1. **`capture/inbox/`** - any `.txt` or `.md` file in this folder is treated as a capture. This is the drop zone: synced-folder dictation, exported voice notes, anything that can land as a text file.
2. **Pasted text** - if the founder pasted content with this request, treat the paste as one capture.
3. **Connected meeting-notes tool** - if a `meeting_notes` MCP is bound in `stack.json` and reachable, offer to pull transcripts since the last sweep. Never claim to have checked a tool that is not connected.

## Procedure

1. **Sweep.** For each capture, create `brain/rants/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>.md` with frontmatter:

   ```
   ---
   captured: <date from the file's own timestamp or content, else today>
   source: <inbox filename | paste | meeting-notes tool>
   processed: false
   ---
   ```

   Body = the raw text, corrected ONLY per the name pass below. Never rewrite, summarize, or clean up the founder's words at this stage - raw in, raw kept.

2. **Name pass (transcription errors are the rule, not the exception).** Dictation mangles proper nouns. Before filing:
   - Read `context/names.md` (the names glossary). For any name in the capture that closely matches a glossary entry or a listed mishearing, substitute the canonical spelling. Substitute ONLY on a glossary match.
   - A proper noun that matches nothing stays as heard, marked `(sp?)` - for example `Jansi (sp?)`. Collect all `(sp?)` names and ask the founder about them in ONE batch question at the end of the sweep, not one by one.
   - When the founder corrects a name, apply it AND append the wrong-to-right pair to the glossary's mishearings list, so the same mistake never survives twice.
   - Never "fix" a name, number, price, or date you are unsure of. An unsure span stays as heard with the marker. A confident wrong substitution is how fabricated facts enter a brain; the marker is how they stay out.

3. **Move, don't copy.** A swept inbox file moves to `capture/inbox/.processed/` (create if missing) so the inbox reads empty when it IS empty. Nothing is deleted.

4. **Report and offer.** One line per capture filed (`filed brain/rants/2026-07-08-site-visit.md - 2 names confirmed, 1 marked (sp?)`), then offer: "Say 'dream' (or run /dream) and I will distil these into patterns, flags, and decisions." Do not auto-run /dream.

## If two sources cover the same event

When the same conversation arrives twice (say, a meeting-notes tool and the founder's own voice memo), reconcile by this hierarchy - higher wins:

1. A document or screenshot (authoritative for names, numbers, terms)
2. What both sources independently agree on
3. A single source - file it, but mark facts only it carries as `(single-source)`
4. The founder's own correction - overrides everything above

A proper noun the two sources disagree on is surfaced as provisional, never silently picked.

## Rules

- Raw in, raw kept. No summarizing, no cleanup beyond the glossary name pass.
- Every capture gets `processed: false` so /dream can find it. Never mark processed here.
- Ask about unknown names once, in one batch. Never write an invented identity, venture, or fact to make a capture look complete.
- If `capture/inbox/` does not exist, create it with its README from `templates/capture/inbox/README.md` and tell the founder what it is for.
- No em dashes or en dashes. Hyphens only.
