description: >
  File a source (URL, file path, or pasted text) into raw/ with provenance preserved. Trigger on "ingest this", "process this source", "file this article", "save this transcript", "add this thread to the OS" (or run /founder-os:ingest). Also fires when the user shares a source they want preserved alongside extracted takeaways. Proposes wiki updates the user approves before writing. Different from knowledge-capture - ingest preserves the source.

# Ingest

Files a source into the OS with provenance preserved. The raw layer becomes the immutable archive; the wiki layer holds the extracted, derived content with cross-links back to the source.

This skill must:
- Auto-write only the raw source. Every wiki update requires explicit user approval.
- Run on a fresh install (creates `raw/` lazily on first use).
- Never modify a file in `raw/` after it's written.
- Append a single line to `brain/log.md` capturing what was ingested and what wiki updates landed.
- Render the proposal in under 3 seconds for sources under 50KB.

---

## Pre-flight

1. If `core/identity.md` does not exist, stop with: `Founder OS not set up here. Run /founder-os:setup first.`
2. If `raw/` directory does not exist, create it and copy `templates/raw/README.md` into it (so the convention is documented locally).

## Step 1 - Resolve the source

Detect what the user passed in the argument:

- **URL** (matches `https?://`) - fetch with WebFetch. If WebFetch fails, ask the user to paste the content directly.
- **File path** (exists on disk per Glob) - Read the file content.
- **Anything else** - treat as pasted text. The argument body IS the source.

Determine `source_type` from URL or content:
- gist.github.com or raw markdown -> `gist`
- youtube.com, podcast platforms, audio transcript -> `podcast` (or `transcript` if cleaner)
- arxiv, pdf, paper -> `article`
- twitter.com, x.com, linkedin.com posts, reddit threads -> `thread`
- generic article URL -> `article`
- file ending .pdf, .epub, .mobi -> `book`
- otherwise -> `document` or `other`

Determine `source_title`:
- For URLs: extract page title from fetched content. Fall back to URL slug.
- For file paths: use the filename.
- For pasted text: ask the user for a one-line title if not obvious from the first line.

Determine `source_author`:
- For URLs: extract from byline/meta if found, otherwise omit.
- Otherwise: omit unless obvious.

## Step 2 - Write the raw file

Filename: `raw/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md` where `<slug>` is a kebab-case 3-5 word version of the title.

If a file with that name already exists, append `-2`, `-3`, etc.

Write the file with this structure:

```markdown
---
source_type: <type>
source_url: <url if applicable, omit if not>
source_title: <title>
source_author: <author if known, omit if not>
ingested_at: <YYYY-MM-DD>
ingested_by: ingest
wiki_pages: []
---

<the full source content>
```

`wiki_pages` is left empty for now. It gets updated in Step 6 with whatever the user approved.

Confirm to the user: `Source filed to raw/<filename>. Now proposing wiki updates.`

## Step 3 - Extract candidate wiki updates

Read the source. Extract candidate updates across these categories:

| Category | Target file | What qualifies |
|---|---|---|
| Entity | `context/entities/<slug>.md` (new) | A person, company, framework, concept that doesn't already have a page. Check `context/entities/` first. |
| Decision input | `context/decisions.md` (append) | Information that bears on an open or pending decision. Check current `context/decisions.md` for matches. |
| Pattern | `brain/patterns.md` (append) | A recurring pattern, observation, or principle worth remembering. |
| Action item | `cadence/daily-anchors.md` or `cadence/weekly-commitments.md` (append to Could Do) | A concrete next action surfaced by the source. |
| Reference | `context/companies/<name>.md` (append) | Information specific to a company or business already in the OS. |

Aim for 2-5 candidates total. Do NOT propose more than 7. If a source produces zero clear candidates, that's fine - proceed to Step 4 with an empty list.

## Step 4 - Show proposal to user

Output the proposal as a single fenced block:

```
INGESTED: <title>
Source: raw/<filename>

Proposed wiki updates (you approve each):

[1] <category>: <target file>
    <one-sentence summary of the proposed addition>

[2] <category>: <target file>
    <one-sentence summary>

...

Reply with: yes (all), or list numbers to keep (e.g. "1,3"), or no (skip all).
```

If there are zero candidates: `No clear wiki updates surfaced. Source filed to raw/<filename> for later reference.` Then jump to Step 6 with an empty approval list.

## Step 5 - Apply approved updates

For each approved update:

- **Entity (new file):** Write `context/entities/<slug>.md` with a short summary, the source link `[[raw/<filename>]]`, and any cross-references to existing wiki files.
- **Decision input (append):** Append to `context/decisions.md` under the relevant decision header with provenance: `Per [[raw/<filename>]]: <update>`.
- **Pattern (append):** Append to `brain/patterns.md`: `## YYYY-MM-DD - <pattern title>` plus body and `[[raw/<filename>]]` reference.
- **Action item (append):** Append to the relevant cadence file's "Could Do" section with `[[raw/<filename>]]` reference.
- **Reference (append):** Append to the company file under a "Source notes" section with `[[raw/<filename>]]` reference.

Use `[[wiki-link]]` syntax for all cross-references per the Wiki Conventions in CLAUDE.md.

## Step 6 - Update raw frontmatter and brain log

1. Edit the raw file's frontmatter to fill `wiki_pages` with the actually-written list. Empty list if user declined all.

2. Append a single line to `brain/log.md`:
   ```
   ## YYYY-MM-DD ingest | <source title> | wiki updates: <list of files written, or "none">
   ```

## Step 7 - Output summary

Five-line confirmation:

```
INGESTED: <title>
RAW: raw/<filename>
WIKI UPDATES: <count> (<list of files>)
LOG: brain/log.md updated
NEXT: Run /founder-os:lint anytime to audit cross-references.
```

## Output rules

- No em dashes or en dashes. Hyphens only.
- No banned words (delve, robust, seamless, leverage as verb, comprehensive, holistic, transformative, streamline, optimize, utilize, facilitate, unlock, navigate, ecosystem, landscape).
- Keep the proposal block scannable. One line per candidate plus one body line.
- Never write to a wiki file without explicit user approval. raw/ is the only auto-write.
- If the user declines all proposals, that's a valid outcome. The source still got filed.

## Edge cases

- **Duplicate source.** If a raw/ file with the same source_url already exists, ask: `This source was ingested on <date>. Re-ingest with a fresh proposal?` Default: no.
- **Very large source (>200KB).** Truncate content in the raw file to the first 200KB and append `... [truncated, original at <url>]`. Note in proposal that extraction was truncated.
- **WebFetch fails.** Ask user to paste the content. Do not make up content.
- **Source has no extractable structure** (e.g., a tweet, a one-line note). Filing to raw/ is still valuable. Output proposal: `No clear wiki updates from this source. Filed for reference.`
- **User says "yes" to a category but the target file is missing.** Create the target file first, then write the update. Mention the file creation in the summary.
